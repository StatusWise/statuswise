# GitHub Actions Workflows

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the **optimized** GitHub Actions workflows used in the StatusWise project. These workflows have been streamlined to eliminate duplication and improve efficiency while maintaining comprehensive automation coverage.

## 📋 Optimized Workflow Overview

Our CI/CD and automation processes are now managed by **5 streamlined workflows** (reduced from 7):

1. **`ci.yml` (Unified CI/CD Pipeline)**: ⚡ **CONSOLIDATED** - Now includes both testing AND code quality checks for fast feedback on every push/PR
2. **`test-environments.yml` (Compatibility Testing)**: 🧪 **OPTIMIZED** - Matrix-based testing across Python, Node.js, and PostgreSQL versions with reduced duplication
3. **`automation.yml` (Repository Automation)**: 🤖 **UNCHANGED** - Handles project management, auto-labeling, and repository automation
4. **`deploy.yml` (Deployment Management)**: 🚀 **OPTIMIZED** - Uses reusable components and improved build strategies
5. **`deploy-check.yml` (Pre-deployment Validation)**: ✅ **OPTIMIZED** - Uses shared setup components
6. **`release.yml` (Release Management)**: 📦 **MODERNIZED** - Updated with modern actions and automated changelog generation

## 🚀 Usage and Triggers

### Fast Feedback (Every Push/PR)

On every push to `main`/`develop` branches and every commit to PRs targeting these branches:

- ✅ `ci.yml` - **FAST** comprehensive pipeline (tests + linting + quality checks)
- ✅ `deploy-check.yml` - Pre-deployment validation (on PRs to main only)

**Timeline**: ~5-8 minutes for complete feedback

### Comprehensive Testing (Manual/Scheduled)

- ✅ `test-environments.yml` - **Label-triggered** with `run-compat-tests` or weekly schedule
- ✅ Weekly compatibility checks across all supported versions

**Timeline**: ~15-20 minutes for full compatibility matrix

### Production Operations

- ✅ `deploy.yml` - Manual deployment trigger or automatic on main/develop
- ✅ `release.yml` - Automatic on version tag push (v*)

2. Add environment-specific configuration
3. Configure deployment secrets
4. Test with `workflow_dispatch`

### Monitoring Workflow Performance
- Check **Actions** tab for execution times
- Monitor **step summaries** for detailed insights
- Review **artifact retention** policies quarterly
- Update **cache keys** when dependencies change
