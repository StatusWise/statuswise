## Setup & Installation

### 1. Database Migration

Run the migration script to add admin functionality to existing installations:

```bash
cd backend
python add_admin_migration.py
```

This will:
- Add `is_admin`, `created_at`, and `updated_at` columns to the users table
- Optionally create an initial admin user

### 2. Admin User Creation

During migration, you can create an admin user or promote an existing user:

```bash
# During migration
Would you like to create an admin user? (y/n): y
Enter admin email: admin@yourdomain.com
Enter admin password: [secure_password]
```

### 3. Backend Restart

After migration, restart your backend server:

```bash
# Development
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Production
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Database Verification

```sql
-- Check admin users
SELECT id, email, is_admin, created_at FROM users WHERE is_admin = true;

-- Check user table structure
DESCRIBE users;
```
