# Google OAuth Setup Guide

StatusWise uses Google OAuth for secure, password-free authentication. This guide will walk you through setting up Google OAuth for your StatusWise instance.

## üîß Prerequisites

- Google account
- StatusWise repository cloned locally
- Basic understanding of environment variables

## üìã Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Create Google Cloud Project

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console**
   - Visit [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Sign in with your Google account

2. **Create or Select Project**
   - Click the project dropdown at the top
   - Click "New Project" or select an existing project
   - Give your project a name (e.g., "StatusWise OAuth")
   - Click "Create"

### 2. Enable Required APIs

1. **Navigate to APIs & Services**
   - In the Google Cloud Console, go to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   
2. **Enable Google Identity Services**
   - Search for "Google Identity"
   - Click "Google Identity Toolkit API" or "Google+ API"
   - Click "Enable"

### 3. Configure OAuth Consent Screen

1. **Go to OAuth Consent Screen**
   - Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "OAuth consent screen"
   
2. **Choose User Type**
   - Select "External" for public applications
   - Select "Internal" if you're using Google Workspace and want to restrict to your organization
   - Click "Create"

3. **Fill Required Information**
   - **App name**: StatusWise (or your custom name)
   - **User support email**: Your email address
   - **Developer contact email**: Your email address
   - **App domain** (optional): Your domain if you have one
   - **App logo** (optional): Upload a logo if desired
   - Click "Save and Continue"

4. **Scopes** (Next Screen)
   - The default scopes are sufficient for StatusWise
   - Click "Save and Continue"

5. **Test Users** (if External)
   - Add email addresses of users who can test your app
   - **Important**: Include your admin email address here
   - Click "Save and Continue"

### 4. Create OAuth Credentials

1. **Go to Credentials**
   - Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"

2. **Configure OAuth Client**
   - **Application type**: Web application
   - **Name**: StatusWise Web Client
   
3. **Set Authorized Origins**
   For development:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```
   
   For production:
   ```
   https://yourdomain.com
   ```

4. **Set Authorized Redirect URIs**
   For development:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/login
   ```
   
   For production:
   ```
   https://yourdomain.com/login
   ```

5. **Create and Download**
   - Click "Create"
   - **Copy the Client ID** (you'll need this)
   - **Copy the Client Secret** (you'll need this)
   - You can also download the JSON file for backup

## üîê Configure StatusWise

### 1. Backend Configuration

Edit `backend/.env`:

```bash
# Required: Google OAuth
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id-from-google-console
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret-from-google-console

# Admin user (automatically becomes admin on first login)
ADMIN_EMAIL=your-admin-email@example.com

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/statuswise

# Security (generate secure random strings)
SECRET_KEY=your-secure-secret-key-here
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-jwt-secret-here

# Feature toggles
ENABLE_BILLING=false
ENABLE_ADMIN=true
```

### 2. Frontend Configuration

Edit `frontend/.env`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id-from-google-console
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: The `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` should be the same as the `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` in your backend configuration.

### 3. Admin User Setup

**Important**: Set your `ADMIN_EMAIL` to the email address you want to use as the admin:

- This email address will automatically receive admin privileges when they first sign in
- Make sure this email is added to the "Test Users" list in your OAuth consent screen
- The user with this email can then access the admin dashboard to manage other users

## üöÄ Testing Your Setup

1. **Start StatusWise**
   ```bash
   make dev
   # or
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. **Access the Application**
   - Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - You should see a "Sign in with Google" button

3. **Test Admin Authentication**
   - Click "Sign in with Google"
   - Sign in with the Google account matching your `ADMIN_EMAIL`
   - You should be redirected to the dashboard
   - You should see admin-specific options and can access `/admin`

4. **Test Regular User Authentication**
   - Sign out and sign in with a different Google account
   - This user should have regular (non-admin) access

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Error 400: redirect_uri_mismatch"**
- Check that your redirect URIs in Google Cloud Console exactly match your application URL
- Ensure no trailing slashes or extra characters

**"Error 403: access_blocked"**
- Your OAuth consent screen might need verification for external users
- Add test users in the OAuth consent screen for testing
- Make sure your admin email is in the test users list

**"Invalid Google token"**
- Check that your `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` is correctly set in both backend and frontend
- Ensure the client ID matches between your Google Cloud Console and environment files

**"Network error"**
- Verify your backend is running on the correct port (8000)
- Check that `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` points to the correct backend URL

**Admin privileges not working**
- Check that `ENABLE_ADMIN=true` in your backend environment
- Verify that `ADMIN_EMAIL` matches exactly with your Google account email
- Check the backend logs for admin privilege grant messages

### Development vs Production

**Development Setup:**
- Use `http://localhost:3000` for origins and redirects
- You can use "External" user type for testing
- Add all test user emails to the OAuth consent screen

**Production Setup:**
- Use your actual domain (e.g., `https://status.yourdomain.com`)
- Consider using "Internal" if you have Google Workspace
- Ensure HTTPS is enabled for production
- Update `ADMIN_EMAIL` to your production admin email
